# Welcome to NCBI EUtilities (site in progress)

EUtilities is an Application Program Interface (API) that helps you gather data from most of the 40 NCBI databases (with greater than 1 billion records) residing at the NCBI. The databases include a variety of biomedical data, including biomedical literature nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, gene expression, genotype and biological assay studies with data, chemical information, and three-dimensional molecular structures. There are about 25 million EUtilities calls sent to our servers daily from about 100,000 different IP addresses.
