# Welcome to E-Utilities (site in progress)

E-Utilities is an Application Program Interface (API) that helps you gather data from most of the 40 NCBI databases (with greater than 1 billion records) residing at the NCBI. The databases include a variety of biomedical data, including biomedical literature nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, gene expression, genotype and biological assay studies with data, chemical information, and three-dimensional molecular structures. There are about 25 million E-Utilities calls sent to our servers daily from about 100,000 different IP addresses.

Here are a few examples of what E-Utilities can do for you:

* Search PubMed with a term and retrieve PMIDs (Add link here to ID)
* Search MedGen with a SnoMedCI ID, then link over to GTR and retrieve their Summary info
* Save a list of Gene IDs and fetch their full records
* Save a PubChem Compound CID and retrieve the SDF-formatted record to showthe 3D coordinates in the Molecules App (ADD LINK HERE)

Users can access E-utilities by writing API queries and pasting them into any internet browser.
